This is a brand new problem, so many hospital administrators are struggling to come up with the correct guidelines.

* The ideal way to control a pandemic is with very sensitive testing. 
    * We have a sensitive test called polymerase chain reaction. 
    * It's an old technology. One of the ingredients is called "primer," and you have to have the whole genome if the virus mapped before you start making it.  
        * That means you can't stock up a ton of primer ahead of time, although you can stockpile other ingredients. 
        * You have to be able to react quickly once a new virus is discovered. 
        * For [reasons](https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/17/21184015/coronavirus-testing-pcr-diagnostic-point-of-care-cdc-techonology), we found ourselves at the beginning of the spread in the United States that we were completely unable to test patients, let alone their contacts.  
        * I believe most labs were planning on sourcing their tests from Roche in Germany.
            * You'll see that Germany has much lower case fatility rate because they probably do not have a lot of people walking around with the virus without knowing it.
        * A handful of countries around the world have done this, but we have not.
    * Now that he virus is spreading, we need to do what [Wuhan did](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/30/life-on-lockdown-in-china), manufacture huge amounts of PPE very quickly. 
        * We don't have the manufacturing capability for that either.
        * We are ordering N-95 masks from [china](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GpMvD4Z-jWdifo5ZQnJB7HHsOwwdj1tjTPkw6f2Kshg/edit?fbclid=IwAR1qcT6ZPmBwE0-1XghRyBdaMTPT6ckntqjqXUDDBkX3fyS4XbnAV6eNMTY#gid=0).
            * Now that they are getting things under control, they are starting to produce more masks than they need.
            * I have people offering on my doctor facebook groups to sell me masks 25,000 at a time for $4 apiece.
            * Assuming they are legitimade, there will be a 5 day lead time to get shipped here.
            * You can probably get [infected through your eyeballs](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/3047394/chinese-expert-who-came-down-wuhan-coronavirus-after-saying-it-was?fbclid=IwAR1h4ypg29EaxIQDERdAKsWfrnPEOdBUPC7ZlAkdef1iG0idn8mCLAJGhZo) anyway, meaning you actually need full face respirators.
            * In the meantime, CDC has helpful hints regarding how to preserve N-95 masks in a crisis:
                * [Wear your mask all day](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/4/e006577?fbclid=IwAR1jsNn00m2dkJ89_pnjiysHqwshQvJ0hbtAogVnDTihKj2ykruNT-_Bci8)
                * [How to sterilize masks](https://twitter.com/larrychu/status/1241842040519843840?fbclid=IwAR0Yu5quq9J1YUej5VltefhKiQ1g4cUuKfatTXXLemdC9c89n00_rNP1lvs)
                * [Cloth masks are not great](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/4/e006577?fbclid=IwAR1jsNn00m2dkJ89_pnjiysHqwshQvJ0hbtAogVnDTihKj2ykruNT-_Bci8), so people are using them as covers for their respirators

* The virus is spreading in such a way that it's [suspected to be spread by aerosol](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202002.0283/download/final_file).
    * This is controversial. It may be that actually aerosols [coming from toilets](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/16/coronavirus-can-become-aerosol-doesnt-mean-doomed/) are more to blame.
    * Droplets [1 millionth of a meter or smaller](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kuo-Pin_Yu/publication/5690136_The_Size_and_Concentration_of_Droplets_Generated_by_Coughing_in_Human_Subjects/links/02e7e520daa11c7879000000.pdf) are produced when people cough.
    * We even generate some aerosols [when we breathe](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3591312/).  
        * Small airways collapse as we breathe out, then fling water droplets into the air when they reopen.
    * The virus is 15 billionths of a meter across, so it could get swept up in these aerosols.
    * [Smaller aerosol particles get deeper into your lungs.](https://oeh.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00028896909343120#.XnpevohKhPZ)
    * The less humid it gets, the smaller the particles become. When it is humid, the salts in the droplets can [pull additional moisture out of the air](https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/1520-0450%281975%29014%3C1044%3AAFFTES%3E2.0.CO%3B2).
    * About half of aerosol particles will drift to the ground over the [course of an hour](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/16/coronavirus-can-become-aerosol-doesnt-mean-doomed/).

* This coronavirus is different from other coronaviruses that cause the common cold.
    * It lives outside the human body for longer than most others.
    * It is different from most common colds because it sticks to the alveoli, the smallest part of your lungs, where your body exchanges gasses with the air.
    * Hospitals are projected to run out of ventilators if any significant portion of the population gets sick at the same time.
    * Ventilators won't save you anyway.
        * [97%](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30633-4/fulltext) of people who go on a ventilator die. 
        * People need [ECMO](https://www.ucsfhealth.org/treatments/extracorporeal-membrane-oxygenation) and hardly any hospitals have it.


* The people who are continuing to work in hospitals right now are heros.
    * Many of them, especially the older ones, are going to die.
    * If we are going to prioritize younger people to have ventilators, we ought to give telework to the older workers.

* Shelter in place is the only responsible thing for public officials to do right now.
    * People continue to go out given the choice.
        * Even a few will ruin it for everyone.
    * Hospitals in cities that do not have early shelter in place orders will be overrun the worst.
        * Doctors are advocating [refusing to come to work](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/were-failing-doctors/608662/?fbclid=IwAR2hZ2vO5kMguBEXZ4KuBeps_O8J_j1fPWNWQuZKvisVZGDlTov4aDKMTVw) because the immense danger was just so avoidable.
    * We are assuming that the virus goes away after we develop immunity but we don't know that.
        * There are reports of people getting re-infected        
    * If we ever want to eradicate this, we need lots and lots of PCR.
        * Part of the problem with PCR is much of it is done by hand and it's easy to mess up.
        * The final step, amplification, has become more automated over time.
        * The intial steps of cleaning the sample and making the first copies must be done by hand.
        * I started an open-source project to fully automate the process https://github.com/geoffMay/covidVeterans
    * The absolute worst thing we can do is pretend that the problem will solve itself.
        * If parts of the world control the virus and others don't, what effect would that have on the economy of those that don't?
            * The WHO is [already predicting this will happen in the United States](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-who-usa-idUSKBN21B1FT?utm_campaign=trueAnthem%3A+Trending+Content&utm_medium=trueAnthem&utm_source=facebook&fbclid=IwAR1RhgOyq7q9pGbrJ8VRQob7WfsJk2otFVNzivFmnEbuqsKAAzNl8HE1wGo).
    * We still have time to take the correct action
        * shelter in place everywhere
        * essential services keep running
        * massive amounts of PPE for hospitals
        * hold CEOs of hospitals accountable for [irresponsible policies](https://vocal.media/theSwamp/covid-pandemic-exposes-the-ugly-secrets-hidden-in-america-s-healthcare-system?fbclid=IwAR1c7BhK49vFR4IvySUwujXxM0NAy5-Ee5uxJyeZ1ChLe08pBqJ-UaqQk40)
